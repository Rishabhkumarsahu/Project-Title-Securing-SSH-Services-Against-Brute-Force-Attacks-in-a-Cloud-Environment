# Major Project – SSH Security Hardening

## Project Title
Securing SSH Services Against Brute-Force Attacks in a Cloud Environment

## Description
This project demonstrates a real-world SSH brute-force attack on a cloud-based Linux server, followed by log analysis and security hardening to prevent re-attacks.

## Technologies Used
- AWS EC2
- Ubuntu Linux
- SSH (OpenSSH)
- Hydra
- Linux Authentication Logs

## Project Phases
1. Vulnerable SSH configuration
2. SSH brute-force attack (Red Team)
3. Log analysis and detection (Blue Team)
4. SSH security hardening
5. Re-attack validation (attack failed)

## Outcome
After applying SSH hardening, password-based attacks were blocked and only key-based authentication was allowed, proving improved security posture.
